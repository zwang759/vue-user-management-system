### Is it good to connect to a real backend server?
<p> No, better to create a few more components, for example, a spinner, to let users know it is processing, 
and a alert, to let users know if their operations are successful or not </p>

### Is it good for production ?
<p> No, do not use it for production. For a SPA, there are more things to do.
Consider doing search engine optimization </p>
